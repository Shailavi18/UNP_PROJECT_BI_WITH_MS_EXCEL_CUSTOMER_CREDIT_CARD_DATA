# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_MS_EXCEL_CUSTOMER_CREDIT_CARD_DATA 

I have done this project in collaboration with UNP education. The Project involves analysing the Customer Credit card data and interpreting the results. I have created an Excel dashboard and various KPIs namely average income by Occupation type, Education type and age. Income type by gender, Employment status by age range and gender by age range. I have applied various excel tools such as Slicers, pivot tables and filters. To depict results in a visual way I have used Pie charts and bar graphs which analyses customer spending habits. The dashboard facilitates decision making by offering valuable insights for financial analysis and presents information in a concise and easily understandable format. This project provided practical experience. It significantly strengthened ability to analyse financial data.
